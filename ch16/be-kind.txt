Exercises: Be Kind

Given a type signature, determine the kinds of each type variable:

1. What's the kind of a?

   a -> a

Ans: *, since the kind of (->) is * -> * -> *.

2. What are the kinds of b and T? (The T is capitalized on purpose!)

   a -> b a -> T (b a)

Ans: a has kind *, b a has kind *. So, b has kind * -> *. Also, T has kind
     * -> *.

3. What's the kind of c?

   c a b -> c b a
