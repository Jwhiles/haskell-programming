Exercises: Mood Swing

Given,

data Mood = Blah | Woot deriving Show

1. The type constructor is Mood.

2. The values you can use are Blah and Woot.

3. Woot is a data constructor and so cannot appear in the type signature. It
   can only be used at the term level, not the type level. The type signature
   should be Mood -> Mood.

4. changeMood Blah = Woot
   changeMood    _ = Blah

5. See mood.hs
