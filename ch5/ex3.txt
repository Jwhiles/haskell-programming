1. Given type a -> a, we can define

id :: a -> a
id x = x

I don't know anything about x so all I can do is return it.

2. Given type a -> a -> a, we can define

pair :: a -> a -> a
pair x y = x

or

pair x y = y

We can't even combine the values because we don't know what operations would
work on them.

3. Given type a -> b -> b, we can define

snd :: a -> b -> b
snd x y = y

There is only one possible implementation.

If we know more about a and b then the behaviour can change because we may be
able to use more operations on them to return something different.
